							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I loved the ways in which I could see the impact of my major on UX. I never thought about the ways in which I focus on certain aspects of the website than others, which makes this article helpful for the final project. My favorite example was about the driving which shows how visual and auditory might be a better fit that visuals on visuals. </p>
